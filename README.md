# My personal website

This is by no means a finished project and not very professionally done in most areas.

This is my personal website. Primarily used for that purpose but there are a few other projects.

I use it to play around with ideas, show off work, and practice with libraries.

# About

The website is a nodejs backend. A mix of mostly custom, materialize, metroui frontend css.
Proxy server is nginx.

The Home Page is a 3D Solar System demo made with Three.js. From there you can go to my Automaton/Paper.js demo and also a basic sample website.
