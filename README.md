# My personal website

This is by know means a finished project and not very professional done in most areas.

This is my personal website. I use it to play around with ideas, show off work, and practice with libraries.

Website: bscal.me

I will get a domain some day.

# About

The website is a nodejs backend. A mix of mostly materialize and metroui frontend css.
Proxy server is nginx.

The Home Page is a 3D Solar System demo made with Three.js. From there you can go to my Automaton/Paper.js demo and also a basic sample website.
